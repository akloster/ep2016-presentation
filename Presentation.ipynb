    "First of all, the Mindwave is a lot cheaper. The Muse theoretically offers more and better data, but it may be hard to actually exploit this data. On the other hand, the Mindwave only has one channel, and some neurofeedback protocols require two or more of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mindwave seems to be especially focused on being hackable. The raw signal arrives in a preprocessed form, which makes dealing with it slightly easier. The protocol also provides two values called \"meditation\" and \"attention\", which are computed inside the headset. This makes the headset useful even to a computer as simple as the arduino.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd say the Muse is less \"hackable\" than the Mindwave. It's more difficult to get the SDKs working, and the protocol and its documentation is confusing. There is an SDK for the Muse, but I prefer to interact with the headset directly in Python. The raw signal is much more \"raw\" than in the Neurosky Mindwave. This means you have more control over the signal analysis, but it also means you have to do all of the analysis yourself. Clearly it requires more processing power, but this hardly matters in practice."
