Slides for "Brainwaves for Hackers 3.0"
=============

This is the presentation notebook for my talk "Brainwaves for Hackers 3.0"
at EuroPython 2016 in Bilbao. It is kind of executable, though it will be
hard to get it to actually work. It does show how everything works, however,
and the Notes describe the slides.

At the very least, you will need my library "pysiology" to get it to work.

I left out some images because of copyright restrictions.
